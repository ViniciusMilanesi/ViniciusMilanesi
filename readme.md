/* Hello World, i'm Vinicius, 16 years old, currently living on Santa Catarina, Brazil
I'm learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML, but i am really new, so I don't have any experience or knowladge yet, but i really like programming and when i'm learning something new i get a lot of inspiration, sometimes i have even more ideas than what i can really do, then i get tired and look for something that i've not tried yet and the inspiration come back
I don't really know how Git works and on what do i could use it, but my mind is open to new ideas and concepts, so i'm really just observating and getting knowladge
If you get interested on my 'story' and wanna talk about anything, maybe teach something, idk, say a "Hi", as i said, my mind is opened to new ideas. */
